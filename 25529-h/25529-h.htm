Danny Meadow<br />
Mouse Is Worried</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">D</span>anny Meadow Mouse</span>
sat on his doorstep with his
chin in his hands, and it was
very plain to see that Danny had
something on his mind. He had
only a nod for Jimmy Skunk,
and even Peter Rabbit could get
no more than a grumpy &#8220;Good
morning.&#8221; It wasn't that he had
been caught napping the day before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
by Reddy Fox and nearly
made an end of. No, it wasn't
that. Danny had learned his
lesson, and Reddy would never
catch him again. It wasn't that
he was all alone with no one to
play with. Danny was rather glad
that he was alone. The fact is,
Danny Meadow Mouse was worried.</p>

<p>Now worry is one of the worst
things in the world, and it didn't
seem as if there was anything
that Danny Meadow Mouse need
worry about. But you know it is
the easiest thing in the world
to find something to worry over
and make yourself uncomfortable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
about. And when you make yourself
uncomfortable, you are almost
sure to make everyone around
you equally uncomfortable. It
was so with Danny Meadow
Mouse. Striped Chipmunk had
twice called him &#8220;Cross Patch&#8221;
that morning, and Johnny Chuck,
who had fought Reddy Fox for
him the day before, had called
him &#8220;Grumpy.&#8221; And what do you
think was the matter with Danny
Meadow Mouse? Why, he was
worrying because his tail was
short. Yes, Sir, that is all that
ailed Danny Meadow Mouse that
bright morning.</p>

<p>You know, some people let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
their looks make them miserable.
They worry because they are
homely or freckled, or short or
tall, or thin or stout, all of which
is very foolish. And Danny
Meadow Mouse was just as foolish
in worrying because his tail
was short.</p>

<p>It is short! It certainly is all of
that! Danny never had realized
how short until he chanced to
meet his cousin Whitefoot, who
lives in the Green Forest. He was
very elegantly dressed, but the
most imposing thing about him
was his long, slim, beautiful tail.
Danny had at once become conscious
of his own stubby little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
tail, and he had hardly had pride
enough to hold his head up
as became an honest Meadow
Mouse. Ever since, he had been
thinking and thinking, and wondering
how his family came to
have such short tails. Then he
grew envious and began to wish
and wish and wish that he could
have a long tail like his cousin
Whitefoot.</p>

<p>He was so busy wishing that he
had a long tail that he quite forgot
to take care of the tail he did
have, and he pretty nearly lost it
and his life with it. Old Whitetail
the Marsh Hawk spied Danny
sitting there moping on his doorstep,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and came sailing over the
tops of the meadow grasses so
softly that he all but caught
Danny. If it hadn't been for one
of the Merry Little Breezes,
Danny would have been caught.
And all because he was envious.
It's a bad, bad habit.</p>

Danny Meadow
Mouse<br /> and His
Short Tail</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">A</span>ll</span> Danny Meadow Mouse
could think about was his
short tail. He was so ashamed of
it that whenever anyone passed,
he crawled out of sight so that
they should not see how short
his tail was. Instead of playing in
the sunshine as he used to do,
he sat and sulked. Pretty soon his
friends began to pass without
stopping. Finally one day old Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Toad sat down in front of Danny
and began to ask questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;What's the matter?&#8221; asked old
Mr. Toad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; replied Danny
Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't suppose there really is
anything the matter, but what do
you think is the matter?&#8221; said old
Mr. Toad.</p>

<p>Danny fidgeted, and old Mr.
Toad looked up at jolly, round,
red Mr. Sun and winked. &#8220;Sun
is just as bright as ever, isn't it?&#8221;
he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Danny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got plenty to eat and drink,
haven't you?&#8221; continued Mr.
Toad.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p class="figcenter"><a name="illo2" id="illo2"></a><a href="images/019.jpg"><img src="images/019_th.jpg"
alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p class="caption"><i>&#8220;Got plenty to eat and drink, haven't you?&#8221;
continued Mr. Toad</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Danny.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me that that is a
pretty good-looking suit of clothes
you're wearing,&#8221; said Mr. Toad,
eyeing Danny critically. &#8220;Sunny
weather, plenty to eat and drink,
and good clothes&mdash;must be you
don't know when you're well off,
Danny Meadow Mouse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Danny hung his head. Finally
he looked up and caught a kindly
twinkle in old Mr. Toad's eyes.
&#8220;Mr. Toad, how can I get a long
tail like my cousin Whitefoot of
the Green Forest?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;So that's what's the matter!
Ha! ha! ha! Danny Meadow
Mouse, I'm ashamed of you! I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
certainly am ashamed of you!&#8221;
said Mr. Toad. &#8220;What good would
a long tail do you? Tell me that.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a minute Danny didn't
know just what to say. &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;I'd
look so much better if I had a
long tail,&#8221; he ventured.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Toad just laughed.
&#8220;You never saw a Meadow Mouse
with a long tail, did you? Of
course not. What a sight it would
be! Why, everybody on the Green
Meadows would laugh themselves
sick at the sight! You see, you
need to be slim and trim and
handsome to carry a long tail
well. And then what a nuisance
it would be! You would always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
have to be thinking of your tail
and taking care to keep it out of
harm's way. Look at me. I'm
homely. Some folks call me ugly
to look at. But no one tries to
catch me as Farmer Brown's boy
does Billy Mink because of his
fine coat; and no one wants to
put me in a cage because of
a fine voice. I am satisfied to
be just as I am, and if you'll
take my advice, Danny Meadow
Mouse, you'll be satisfied to be
just as you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are right,&#8221; said
Danny Meadow Mouse after a
little. &#8220;I'll try.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

Danny Meadow<br />
Mouse Plays Hide-and-Seek</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">L</span>ife</span> is always a game of hide-and-seek
to Danny Meadow
Mouse. You see, he is such a fat
little fellow that there are a great
many other furry-coated people,
and almost as many who
wear feathers, who would gobble
Danny up for breakfast or for
dinner if they could. Some of
them pretend to be his friends,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
but Danny always keeps his eyes
open when they are around and
always begins to play hide-and-seek.
Peter Rabbit and Jimmy
Skunk and Striped Chipmunk
and Happy Jack Squirrel are all
friends whom he can trust, but
he always has a bright twinkling
eye open for Reddy Fox and Billy
Mink and Shadow the Weasel
and old Whitetail the Marsh
Hawk, and several more, especially
Hooty the Owl at night.</p>

<p>Now Danny Meadow Mouse is
a stouthearted little fellow, and
when rough Brother North Wind
came shouting across the Green
Meadows, tearing to pieces the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
snow clouds and shaking out
the snowflakes until they covered
the Green Meadows deep, deep,
deep, Danny just snuggled down
in his warm coat in his snug little
house of grass and waited. Danny
liked the snow. Yes, Sir, Danny
Meadow Mouse liked the snow.
He just loved to dig in it and
make tunnels. Through those
tunnels in every direction he
could go where he pleased and
when he pleased without being
seen by anybody. It was great
fun!</p>

<p>Every little way he made a
little round doorway up beside
a stiff stalk of grass. Out of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
he could peep at the white world,
and he could get the fresh, cold
air. Sometimes, when he was
quite sure that no one was
around, he would scamper across
on top of the snow from one
doorway to another, and when he
did this, he made the prettiest
little footprints.</p>

<p>Now Reddy Fox knew all
about those doorways and who
made them. Reddy was having
hard work to get enough to eat
this cold weather, and he was
hungry most of the time. One
morning, as he came tiptoeing
softly over the meadows, what
should he see just ahead of him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
but the head of Danny Meadow
Mouse pop out of one of those
little round doorways! Reddy's
mouth watered, and he stole forward
more softly than ever.
When he got within jumping
distance, he drew his stout hind
legs under him and made ready
to spring. Presto! Danny Meadow
Mouse had disappeared! Reddy
Fox jumped just the same and
began to dig as fast as he could
make his paws go. He could smell
Danny Meadow Mouse and that
made him almost frantic.</p>

<p>All the time Danny Meadow
Mouse was scurrying along one
of his little tunnels, and when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
finally Reddy Fox stopped digging
because he was quite out of
breath, Danny popped his head
out of another little doorway and
laughed at Reddy. Of course
Reddy saw him, and of course
Reddy tried to catch him there,
and dug frantically just as before.
And of course Danny Meadow
Mouse wasn't there.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Danny popped his head out of another little
doorway and laughed at Reddy</i></p>

<p>After a while Reddy Fox grew
tired of this kind of a game and
tried another plan. The next
time he saw Danny Meadow
Mouse stick his head out, Reddy
pretended not to see him. He
stretched himself out on the
ground and made believe that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
was very tired and sleepy. He
closed his eyes. Then he opened
them just the tiniest bit, so that
he could see Danny Meadow
Mouse and yet seem to be asleep.
Danny watched him for a long
time. Then he chuckled to himself
and dropped out of sight.</p>

<p>No sooner was he gone than
Reddy Fox stole over close to
the little doorway and waited.
&#8220;He'll surely stick his head out
again to see if I'm asleep, and
then I'll have him,&#8221; said Reddy
to himself. So he waited and
waited and waited. By and by
he turned his head. There was
Danny Meadow Mouse at another
little doorway, laughing at him!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>



<h3><a name="IV" id="IV"></a><small>IV</small><br />

Old Granny Fox
Tries<br /> for Danny
Meadow Mouse</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">D</span>anny Meadow Mouse</span>
had not enjoyed anything
so much for a long time as he
did that game of hide-and-seek.
He tickled and chuckled all the
afternoon as he thought about it.
Of course, Reddy had been &#8220;it.&#8221;
He had been &#8220;it&#8221; all the time,
for never once had he caught
Danny Meadow Mouse. If he had&mdash;well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
there wouldn't have been
any more stories about Danny
Meadow Mouse, because there
wouldn't have been any Danny
Meadow Mouse any more.</p>

<p>But Danny never let himself
think about this. He had enjoyed
the game all the more because it
had been such a dangerous game.
It had been such fun to dive
into one of his little round doorways
in the snow, run along one
of his own little tunnels, and
then peep out at another doorway
and watch Reddy Fox digging
as fast as ever he could at
the doorway Danny had just left.
Finally Reddy had given up in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
disgust and gone off muttering
angrily to try to find something
else for dinner. Danny had sat
up on the snow and watched
him go. In his funny little
squeaky voice Danny shouted:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Though Reddy Fox is smart and sly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hi-hum-diddle-de-o!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm just as smart and twice as spry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hi-hum-diddle-de-o!&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That night Reddy Fox told
old Granny Fox all about how
he had tried to catch Danny
Meadow Mouse. Granny listened
with her head cocked on one
side. When Reddy told how fat
Danny Meadow Mouse was, her
mouth watered. You see, now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
that snow covered the Green
Meadows and the Green Forest,
Granny and Reddy Fox had hard
work to get enough to eat, and
they were hungry most of the
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll go with you down on the
meadows tomorrow morning, and
then we'll see if Danny Meadow
Mouse is as smart as he thinks
he is,&#8221; said Granny Fox.</p>

<p>So, bright and early the next
morning, old Granny Fox and
Reddy Fox went down on the
meadows where Danny Meadow
Mouse lives. Danny had felt in
his bones that Reddy would come
back, so he was watching, and he
saw them as soon as they came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
out of the Green Forest. When
he saw old Granny Fox, Danny's
heart beat a little faster than
before, for he knew that Granny
Fox is very smart and very wise,
and has learned most of the tricks
of all the other little meadow
and forest people.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is going to be a more
exciting game than the other,&#8221;
said Danny to himself, and scurried
down out of sight to see
that all his little tunnels were
clear so that he could run fast
through them if he had to. Then
he peeped out of one of his little
doorways hidden in a clump of
tall grass.</p>

<p>Old Granny Fox set Reddy to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
hunting for Danny's little round
doorways, and as fast as he found
them, Granny came up and
sniffed at each. She knew that
she could tell by the smell which
one he had been at last. Finally
she came straight toward the tall
bunch of grass. Danny ducked
down and scurried along one
of his little tunnels. He heard
Granny Fox sniff at the doorway
he had just left. Suddenly something
plunged down through the
snow right at his very heels.
Danny didn't have to look to
know that it was Granny Fox
herself, and he squeaked with
fright.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>



<h3><a name="V" id="V"></a><small>V</small><br />

What Happened on<br />
the Green Meadows</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hick</span> and fast, things were
happening to Danny Meadow
Mouse down on the snow-covered
Green Meadows. Rather, they
were almost happening. He
hadn't minded when Reddy Fox
all alone tried to catch him.
Indeed, he had made a regular
game of hide-and-seek of it and
had enjoyed it immensely. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
now it was different. Granny Fox
wasn't so easily fooled as Reddy
Fox. Just Granny alone would
have made the game dangerous
for Danny Meadow Mouse. But
Reddy was with her, and so
Danny had two to look out for,
and he got so many frights that
it seemed to him as if his heart
had moved right up into his
mouth and was going to stay
there. Yes, Sir, that is just how
it seemed.</p>

<p>Down in his little tunnels
underneath the snow Danny
Meadow Mouse felt perfectly safe
from Reddy Fox, who would
stop and dig frantically at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
little round doorway where he
had last seen Danny. But old
Granny Fox knew all about those
little tunnels, and she didn't
waste any time digging at the
doorways. Instead she cocked her
sharp little ears and listened
with all her might. Now Granny
Fox has very keen ears, oh, very
keen ears, and she heard just
what she hoped she would hear.
She heard Danny Meadow Mouse
running along one of his little
tunnels under the snow.</p>

<p>Plunge! Old Granny Fox dived
right into the snow and right
through into the tunnel of Danny
Meadow Mouse. Her two black<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
paws actually touched Danny's
tail. He was glad then that it was
no longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; cried Granny Fox, &#8220;I
almost got him that time!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she ran ahead a little
way over the snow, listening as
before. Plunge! Into the snow
she went again. It was lucky for
him that Danny had just turned
into another tunnel, for otherwise
she would surely have caught
him.</p>

<p>Granny Fox blew the snow out
of her nose. &#8220;Next time I'll get
him!&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>Now Reddy Fox is quick to
learn, especially when it is a way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to get something to eat. He
watched Granny Fox, and when
he understood what she was doing,
he made up his mind to
have a try himself, for he was
afraid that if she caught Danny
Meadow Mouse, she would think
that he was not big enough to
divide. Perhaps that was because
Reddy is very selfish himself. So
the next time Granny plunged
into the snow and missed Danny
Meadow Mouse just as before,
Reddy rushed in ahead of her,
and the minute he heard Danny
running down below, he plunged
in just as he had seen Granny
do. But he didn't take the pains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to make sure of just where Danny
was, and so of course he didn't
come anywhere near him. But he
frightened Danny still more and
made old Granny Fox lose her
temper.</p>

<p>Poor Danny Meadow Mouse!
He had never been so frightened
in all his life. He didn't know
which way to turn or where to
run. And so he sat still, which,
although he didn't know it, was
the very best thing he could do.
When he sat still he made no
noise, and so of course Granny
and Reddy Fox could not tell
where he was. Old Granny Fox
sat and listened and listened and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
listened, and wondered where
Danny Meadow Mouse was. And
down under the snow Danny
Meadow Mouse sat and listened
and listened and listened, and
wondered where Granny and
Reddy Fox were.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; said Granny Fox after
a while, &#8220;that Meadow Mouse
thinks he can fool me by sitting
still. I'll give him a scare.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she began to plunge into
the snow this way and that way,
and sure enough, pretty soon she
landed so close to Danny Meadow
Mouse that one of her claws
scratched him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">&#8220;T</span>here</span> he goes!&#8221; cried old
Granny Fox. &#8220;Don't let him
sit still again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear him!&#8221; shouted Reddy
Fox, and plunged down into the
snow just as Granny Fox had
done a minute before. But he
didn't catch anything, and when
he had blown the snow out of
his nose and wiped it out of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
eyes, he saw Granny Fox dive
into the snow with no better
luck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Granny
Fox, &#8220;as long as we keep him
running, we can hear him, and
some one of these times we'll
catch him. Pretty soon he'll get
too tired to be so spry, and when
he is&mdash;&#8221; Granny didn't finish, but
licked her chops and smacked her
lips. Reddy Fox grinned, then
licked his chops and smacked his
lips. Then once more they took
turns diving into the snow.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a name="illo4" id="illo4"></a><a href="images/046.jpg"><img src="images/046_th.jpg"
alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p class="caption"><i>Granny didn't finish, but licked her chops
and smacked her lips</i></p>

<p>And down underneath in the
little tunnels he had made,
Danny Meadow Mouse was running<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
for his life. He was getting
tired, just as old Granny Fox had
said he would. He was almost
out of breath. He was sore and
one leg smarted, for in one of
her jumps old Granny Fox had
so nearly caught him that her
claws had torn his pants and
scratched him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear! Oh dear! If only
I had time to think!&#8221; panted
Danny Meadow Mouse, and then
he squealed in still greater fright
as Reddy Fox crashed down into
his tunnel right at his very heels.
&#8220;I've got to get somewhere! I've
got to get somewhere where they
can't get at me!&#8221; he sobbed. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
right that very instant he remembered
the old fence post!</p>

<p>The old fence post lay on the
ground and was hollow. Fastened
to it were long wires with sharp,
cruel barbs. Danny had made a
tunnel over to that old fence
post the very first day after the
snow came, for in that hollow in
the old post he had a secret
store of seeds. Why hadn't he
thought of it before? It must
have been because he was too
frightened to think. But he remembered
now, and he dodged
into the tunnel that led to the
old fence post, running faster
than ever, for though his heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
was in his mouth from fear, in
his heart was hope, and hope is
a wonderful thing.</p>

<p>Now old Granny Fox knew all
about that old fence post and
she remembered all about those
barbed wires fastened to it. Although
they were covered with
snow she knew just about where
they lay, and just before she
reached them she stopped plunging
down into the snow. Reddy
Fox knew about those wires, too,
but he was so excited that he
forgot all about them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; cried old Granny Fox
sharply.</p>

<p>But Reddy Fox didn't hear, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
if he heard he didn't heed. His
sharp ears could hear Danny
Meadow Mouse running almost
underneath him. Granny Fox
could stop if she wanted to, but
he was going to have Danny
Meadow Mouse for his breakfast!
Down into the snow he plunged
as hard as ever he could.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Oh! Wow! Wow! Oh
dear! Oh dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>That wasn't the voice of Danny
Meadow Mouse. Oh, my, no! It
was the voice of Reddy Fox. Yes,
Sir, it was the voice of Reddy
Fox. He had landed with one of
his black paws right on one of
those sharp wire barbs, and it
did hurt dreadfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I never did know a young
Fox who could get into as much
trouble as you can!&#8221; snapped old
Granny Fox, as Reddy hobbled
along on three legs behind her,
across the snow-covered Green
Meadows. &#8220;It serves you right for
forgetting!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes'm,&#8221; said Reddy meekly.</p>

<p>And safe in the hollow of the
old fence post, Danny Meadow
Mouse was dressing the scratch
on his leg made by the claws of
old Granny Fox.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>



<h3><a name="VII" id="VII"></a><small>VII</small><br />

Old Granny Fox<br />
Tries a New Plan</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">O</span>ld Granny Fox</span> kept
thinking about Danny
Meadow Mouse. She knew that
he was fat, and it made her
mouth water every time she
thought of him. She made up
her mind that she must and
would have him. She knew that
Danny had been very, very much
frightened when she and Reddy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Fox had tried so hard to catch
him by plunging down through
the snow into his little tunnels
after him, and she felt pretty
sure that he wouldn't go far away
from the old fence post, in the
hollow of which he was snug and
safe.</p>

<p>Old Granny Fox is very smart.
&#8220;Danny Meadow Mouse won't
put his nose out of that old
fence post for a day or two.
Then he'll get tired of staying inside
all the time, and he'll peep
out of one of his little round
doorways to see if the way is
clear. If he doesn't see any danger,
he'll come out and run<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
around on top of the snow to get
some of the seeds in the tops of
the tall grasses that stick out
through the snow. If nothing
frightens him, he'll keep going a
little farther and a little farther
from that old fence post. I must
see to it that Danny Meadow
Mouse isn't frightened for a few
days.&#8221; So said old Granny Fox to
herself, as she lay under a hemlock
tree, studying how she could
best get the next meal.</p>

<p>Then she called Reddy Fox to
her and forbade him to go down
on the meadows until she should
tell him he might. Reddy grumbled
and mumbled and didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
see why he shouldn't go where
he pleased, but he didn't dare
disobey. You see, he had a sore
foot. He had hurt it on a wire
barb when he was plunging
through the snow after Danny
Meadow Mouse, and now he had
to run on three legs. That meant
that he must depend upon
Granny Fox to help him get
enough to eat. So Reddy didn't
dare to disobey.</p>

<p>It all came out just as Granny
Fox had thought it would.
Danny Meadow Mouse did get
tired of staying in the old fence
post. He did peep out first, and
then he did run a little way on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the snow, and then a little farther
and a little farther. But all the
time he took great care not to get
more than a jump or two from
one of his little round doorways
leading down to his tunnels under
the snow.</p>

<p>Hidden on the edge of the
Green Forest, Granny Fox
watched him. She looked up at
the sky, and she knew that it was
going to snow again. &#8220;That's
good,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Tomorrow
morning I'll have fat Meadow
Mouse for breakfast,&#8221; and she
smiled a hungry smile.</p>

<p>The next morning, before
jolly, round, red Mr. Sun was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
out of bed, old Granny Fox
trotted down onto the meadows
and straight over to where, down
under the snow, lay the old fence
post. It had snowed again, and
all the little doorways of Danny
Meadow Mouse were covered up
with soft, fleecy snow. Behind
Granny Fox limped Reddy Fox,
grumbling to himself.</p>

<p>When they reached the place
where the old fence post lay
buried under the snow, old
Granny Fox stretched out as flat
as she could. Then she told
Reddy to cover her up with the
new soft snow. Reddy did as he
was told, but all the time he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
grumbled. &#8220;Now you go off to
the Green Forest and keep out of
sight,&#8221; said Granny Fox. &#8220;By and
by I'll bring you some Meadow
Mouse for your breakfast,&#8221; and
Granny Fox chuckled to think
how smart she was and how
she was going to catch Danny
Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">D</span>anny Meadow Mouse</span>
had seen nothing of old
Granny Fox or Reddy Fox for
several days. Every morning the
first thing he did, even before he
had breakfast, was to climb up
to one of his little round doorways
and peep out over the beautiful
white meadows, to see if
there was any danger near. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
every time he did this, Danny
used a different doorway. &#8220;For,&#8221;
said Danny to himself, &#8220;if anyone
should happen, just happen,
to see me this morning, they
might be waiting just outside my
doorway to catch me tomorrow
morning.&#8221; You see, there is a
great deal of wisdom in the little
head that Danny Meadow Mouse
carries on his shoulders.</p>

<p>But the first day and the second
day and the third day he saw
nothing of old Granny Fox or of
Reddy Fox, and he began to enjoy
running through his tunnels
under the snow and scurrying
across from one doorway to another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
on top of the snow, just
as he had before the Foxes had
tried so hard to catch him. But
he hadn't forgotten, as Granny
Fox had hoped he would. No,
indeed, Danny Meadow Mouse
hadn't forgotten. He was too wise
for that.</p>

<p>One morning, when he started
to climb up to one of his little
doorways, he found that it was
closed. Yes, Sir, it was closed. In
fact, there wasn't any doorway.
More snow had fallen from the
clouds in the night and had
covered up every one of the
little round doorways of Danny
Meadow Mouse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; said Danny, &#8220;I shall have
a busy day, a very busy day, opening
all my doorways. I'll eat my
breakfast, and then I'll go to
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Danny Meadow Mouse ate a
good breakfast of seeds which he
had stored in the hollow in the
old fence post buried under the
snow, and then he began work on
the nearest doorway. It really
wasn't work at all, for you see,
the snow was soft and light, and
Danny dearly loved to dig in it.
In a few minutes he had made a
wee hole through which he could
peep up at jolly, round, red Mr.
Sun. In a few minutes more he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
had made it big enough to put
his head out. He looked this way
and he looked that way. Far, far
off on the top of a tree he could
see old Roughleg the Hawk, but
he was so far away that Danny
didn't fear him at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't see anything or anybody
to be afraid of,&#8221; said Danny
and poked his head out a little
farther.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a name="illo5" id="illo5"></a><a href="images/064.jpg"><img src="images/064_th.jpg"
alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p class="caption"><i>It was a beautiful white world, a very
beautiful white world</i></p>

<p>Then he sat and studied
everything around him a long,
long time. It was a beautiful
white world, a very beautiful
white world. Everything was so
white and pure and beautiful that
it didn't seem possible that harm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
or danger for anyone could even
be thought of. But Danny
Meadow Mouse learned long ago
that things are not always what
they seem, and so he sat with
just his little head sticking out
of his doorway and studied and
studied. Just a little way off was
a little heap of snow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't remember that,&#8221; said
Danny. &#8220;And I don't remember
anything that would make that.
There isn't any little bush or old
log or anything underneath it.
Perhaps rough Brother North
Wind heaped it up, just for fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>But all the time Danny Meadow
Mouse kept studying and studying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that little heap of snow.
Pretty soon he saw rough Brother
North Wind coming his way and
tossing the snow about as he
came. He caught a handful from
the top of the little heap of snow
that Danny was studying, and
when he had passed, Danny's
sharp eyes saw something red
there. It was just the color of the
cloak old Granny Fox wears.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>shouted Danny Meadow Mouse
and dropped down out of sight,
while old Granny Fox shook the
snow from her red cloak and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
with a snarl of disappointment
and anger, slowly started for the
Green Forest, where Reddy Fox
was waiting for her.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">D</span>anny Meadow Mouse</span>
sang this, or at least he tried
to sing it, as he skipped about on
the snow that covered the Green
Meadows. But Danny Meadow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Mouse has such a little voice, such
a funny little squeaky voice, that
had you been there you probably
would never have guessed that he
was singing. He thought he was,
though, and was enjoying it just
as much as if he had the most
beautiful voice in the world. You
know, singing is nothing in the
world but happiness in the heart
making itself heard.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, Danny Meadow Mouse
was happy! Why shouldn't he
have been? Hadn't he proved himself
smarter than old Granny Fox?
That is something to make anyone
happy. Some folks may fool
Granny Fox once; some may fool<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
her twice; but there are very few
who can keep right on fooling
her until she gives up in disgust.
That is just what Danny Meadow
Mouse had done, and he felt very
smart and of course he felt very
happy.</p>

<p>So Danny sang his little song
and skipped about in the moonlight,
and dodged in and out of
his little round doorways, and all
the time kept his sharp little eyes
open for any sign of Granny Fox
or Reddy Fox. But with all his
smartness, Danny forgot. Yes, Sir,
Danny forgot one thing. He forgot
to watch up in the sky. He
knew that of course old Roughleg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the Hawk was asleep, so he had
nothing to fear from him. But he
never once thought of Hooty the
Owl.</p>

<p>Dear me, dear me! Forgetting is
a dreadful habit. If nobody ever
forgot, there wouldn't be nearly
so much trouble in the world. No,
indeed, there wouldn't be nearly
so much trouble. And Danny
Meadow Mouse forgot. He
skipped and sang and was happy
as could be, and never once
thought to watch up in the sky.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Over in the Green Forest Hooty the Owl
had had poor hunting</i></p>

<p>Over in the Green Forest Hooty
the Owl had had poor hunting,
and he was feeling cross. You see,
Hooty was hungry, and hunger is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
apt to make one feel cross. The
longer he hunted, the hungrier
and crosser he grew. Suddenly he
thought of Danny Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose he is asleep somewhere
safe and snug under the
snow,&#8221; grumbled Hooty, &#8220;but he
might, he just might, be out
for a frolic in the moonlight. I
believe I'll go down on the
meadows and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Hooty the Owl can fly
without making the teeniest,
weeniest sound. It seems as if he
just drifts along through the air
like a great shadow. Now he
spread his great wings and floated
out over the meadows. You know
Hooty can see as well at night as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
most folks can by day, and it was
not long before he saw Danny
Meadow Mouse skipping about
on the snow and dodging in and
out of his little round doorways.
Hooty's great eyes grew brighter
and fiercer. Without a sound he
floated through the moonlight
until he was just over Danny
Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p>Too late Danny looked up. His
little song ended in a tiny squeak
of fear, and he started for his
nearest little round doorway.
Hooty the Owl reached down
with his long cruel claws and&mdash;Danny
Meadow Mouse was caught
at last!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>



<h3><a name="X" id="X"></a><small>X</small><br />

A Strange Ride and<br />
How It Ended</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">D</span>anny Meadow Mouse</span>
often had sat watching Skimmer
the Swallow sailing around
up in the blue, blue sky. He had
watched Ol' Mistah Buzzard go
up, up, up, until he was nothing
but a tiny speck, and Danny had
wondered how it would seem to
be way up above the Green
Meadows and the Green Forest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and look down. It had seemed to
him that it must be very wonderful
and beautiful. Sometimes he
had wished that he had wings
and could go up in the air and
look down. And now here he was,
he, Danny Meadow Mouse, actually
doing that very thing!</p>

<p>But Danny could see nothing
wonderful or beautiful now. No,
indeed! Everything was terrible,
for you see, Danny Meadow
Mouse wasn't flying himself. He
was being carried. Yes, Sir, Danny
Meadow Mouse was being carried
through the air in the cruel claws
of Hooty the Owl! And all because
Danny had forgotten&mdash;forgotten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to watch up in the sky for

<p class="caption"><i>Danny was being carried through the air in
the cruel claws of Hooty the Owl!</i></p>

<p>Poor, poor Danny Meadow
Mouse! Hooty's great cruel claws
hurt him dreadfully! But it wasn't
the pain that was the worst. No,
indeed! It wasn't the pain! It was
the thought of what would happen
when Hooty reached his
home in the Green Forest, for he
knew that there Hooty would
gobble him up, bones and all. As
he flew, Hooty kept chuckling,
and Danny Meadow Mouse knew
just what those chuckles meant.
They meant that Hooty was thinking
of the good meal he was going
to have.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Hanging there in Hooty's great
cruel claws, Danny looked down
on the snow-covered Green Meadows
he loved so well. They
seemed a frightfully long way below
him, though really they were
not far at all, for Hooty was flying
very low. But Danny Meadow
Mouse had never in all his life
been so high up before, and so it
seemed to him that he was way,
way up in the sky, and he shut
his eyes so as not to see. But he
couldn't keep them shut. No, Sir,
he couldn't keep them shut! He
just had to keep opening them.
There was the dear old Green
Forest drawing nearer and nearer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
It always had looked very beautiful
to Danny Meadow Mouse, but
now it looked terrible, very terrible
indeed, because over in it,
hidden away there in some dark
place, was the home of Hooty the
Owl.</p>

<p>Just ahead of him was the Old
Briar-patch where Peter Rabbit
lives so safely. Every old bramble
in it was covered with snow and
it was very, very beautiful. Really
everything was just as beautiful as
ever&mdash;the moonlight, the Green
Forest, the snow-covered Green
Meadows, the Old Briar-patch.
The only change was in Danny
Meadow Mouse himself, and it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
was all because he had forgotten.</p>

<p>Suddenly Danny began to wriggle
and struggle. &#8220;Keep still!&#8221;
snapped Hooty the Owl.</p>

<p>But Danny only struggled
harder than ever. It seemed to
him that Hooty wasn't holding
him as tightly as at first. He felt
one of Hooty's claws slip. It tore
his coat and hurt dreadfully, but
it slipped! The fact is, Hooty had
only grabbed Danny Meadow
Mouse by the loose part of his
coat, and up in the air he couldn't
get hold of Danny any better.
Danny kicked, squirmed, and
twisted, and twisted, squirmed,
and kicked. He felt his coat tear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and of course the skin with it,
but he kept right on, for now
he was hanging almost free. Hooty
had started down now, so as to
get a better hold. Danny gave one
more kick and then&mdash;he felt himself
falling!</p>

<p>Danny Meadow Mouse shut
his eyes and held his breath.
Down, down, down he fell. It
seemed to him that he never
would strike the snow-covered
meadows! Really he fell only a
very little distance. But it seemed
a terrible distance to Danny. He
hit something that scratched him,
and then&mdash;plump!&mdash;he landed in
the soft snow right in the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
middle of the Old Briar-patch,
and the last thing he remembered
was hearing the scream of disappointment
and rage of Hooty the
Owl.</p>

Peter Rabbit Gets<br />
a Fright</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">P</span>eter Rabbit</span> sat in his
favorite place in the middle
of the dear Old Briar-patch, trying
to decide which way he
would go on his travels that
night. The night before he had
had a narrow escape from old
Granny Fox over in the Green
Forest. There was nothing to eat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
around the Smiling Pool and no
one to talk to there any more,
and you know that Peter must
either eat or ask questions in
order to be perfectly happy. No,
the Smiling Pool was too dull a
place to interest Peter on such a
beautiful moonlight night, and
Peter had no mind to try his legs
against those of old Granny Fox
again in the Green Forest.</p>

<p>Early that morning, just after
Peter had settled down for his
morning nap, Tommy Tit the
Chickadee had dropped into the
dear Old Briar-patch just to be
neighborly. Peter was just dozing
off when he heard the cheeriest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
little voice in the world. It was
saying:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Dee-dee-chickadee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see you! Can you see me?&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Peter began to smile even before
he could get his eyes open
and look up. There, right over
his head, was Tommy Tit hanging
head down from a nodding
old bramble. In a twinkling he
was down on the snow right in
front of Peter, then up in the
brambles again, right side up, upside
down, here, there, everywhere,
never still a minute, and
all the time chattering away in
the cheeriest little voice in the
world:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Dee-dee-chickadee!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Dee-dee-chickadee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Everybody's good to me!&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Tommy!&#8221; said Peter
Rabbit. &#8220;Where'd you come
from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From Farmer Brown's new orchard
up on the hill. It's a fine
orchard, Peter Rabbit, a fine orchard.
I go there every morning
for my breakfast. If the winter
lasts long enough, I'll have all the
trees cleaned up for Farmer
Brown.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peter looked puzzled. &#8220;What do
you mean?&#8221; he asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I say,&#8221; replied
Tommy Tit, almost turning a
somersault in the air. &#8220;There's a
million eggs of insects on those
young peach trees, but I'm clearing
them all off as fast as I can.
They're mighty fine eating, Peter
Rabbit, mighty fine eating!&#8221; And
with that Tommy Tit had said
good-by and flitted away.</p>

<p>Peter was thinking of that
young orchard now, as he sat in
the moonlight trying to make up
his mind where to go. The
thought of those young peach
trees made his mouth water. It
was a long way up to the orchard
on the hill, a very long way, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Peter was wondering if it really
was safe to go. He had just about
made up his mind to try it, for
Peter is very, very fond of the
bark of young peach trees, when
thump! something dropped out
of the sky at his very feet.</p>

<p>It startled Peter so that he
nearly tumbled over backward.
And right at the same instant
came the fierce, angry scream of
Hooty the Owl. That almost
made Peter's heart stop beating,
although he knew that Hooty
couldn't get him down there in
the Old Briar-patch. When Peter
got his wits together and his
heart didn't go so jumpy, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
looked to see what had dropped
so close to him out of the sky.
His big eyes grew bigger than
ever, and he rubbed them to
make quite sure that he really
saw what he thought he saw.
Yes, there was no doubt about
it&mdash;there at his feet lay Danny
Meadow Mouse!</p>

The Old Briar-Patch<br />
Has a New Tenant</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">D</span>anny Meadow Mouse</span>
slowly opened his eyes and
then closed them again quickly,
as if afraid to look around. He
could hear someone talking. It
was a pleasant voice, not at all
like the terrible voice of Hooty
the Owl, which was the very last
thing that Danny Meadow Mouse
could remember. Danny lay still
a minute and listened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Danny Meadow Mouse,
where in the world did you
drop from?&#8221; asked the voice. It
sounded like&mdash;why, very much
like Peter Rabbit speaking. Danny
opened his eyes again. It was
Peter Rabbit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&mdash;where am I?&#8221; asked
Danny Meadow Mouse in a very
weak and small voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the middle of the dear
Old Briar-patch with me,&#8221; replied
Peter Rabbit. &#8220;But how did
you get here? You seemed to
drop right out of the sky.&#8221;</p>

<p>Danny Meadow Mouse shuddered.
Suddenly he remembered
everything: how Hooty the Owl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
had caught him in great cruel
claws and had carried him
through the moonlight across
the snow-covered Green Meadows;
how he had felt Hooty's claws
slip and then had struggled and
kicked and twisted and turned
until his coat had torn and he
had dropped down, down, down,
until he had landed in the soft
snow and knocked all the breath
out of his little body. The very
last thing he could remember
was Hooty's fierce scream of rage
and disappointment. Danny shuddered
again.</p>

<p>Then a new thought came to
him. He must get out of sight!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Hooty might catch him again!
Danny tried to scramble to his
feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ouch! Oh!&#8221; groaned Danny
and lay still again.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there. Keep still,
Danny Meadow Mouse. There's
nothing to be afraid of here,&#8221;
said Peter Rabbit gently. His big
eyes filled with tears as he looked
at Danny Meadow Mouse, for
Danny was all torn and hurt by
the cruel claws of Hooty the Owl,
and you know Peter has a very
tender heart.</p>

<p>So Danny lay still, and while
Peter Rabbit tried to make him
comfortable and dress his hurts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
he told Peter all about how he
had forgotten to watch up in the
sky and so had been caught by
Hooty the Owl, and all about his
terrible ride in Hooty's cruel
claws.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, whatever shall I do
now?&#8221; he ended. &#8220;However shall
I get back home to my warm
house of grass, my safe little tunnels
under the snow, and my
little store of seeds in the snug
hollow in the old fence post?&#8221;</p>

<p>Peter Rabbit looked thoughtful.
&#8220;You can't do it,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You
simply can't do it. It is such a
long way for a little fellow like
you that it wouldn't be safe to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
try. If you went at night, Hooty
the Owl might catch you again.
If you tried in daylight, old
Roughleg the Hawk would be
almost sure to see you. And night
or day, old Granny Fox or Reddy
Fox might come snooping
around, and if they did, they
would be sure to catch you. I
tell you what, you stay right
here! The dear Old Briar-patch
is the safest place in the world.
Why, just think, here you can
come out in broad daylight and
laugh at Granny and Reddy Fox
and at old Roughleg the Hawk,
because the good old brambles
will keep them out if they try to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
get you. You can make just as
good tunnels under the snow
here as you had there, and there
are lots and lots of seeds on the
ground to eat. You know I don't
care for them myself. I'm lonesome
sometimes, living here all

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">&#8220;D</span>on't</span> go, Peter Rabbit!
Don't go!&#8221; begged Danny
Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p>Peter hopped to the edge of
the Old Briar-patch and looked
over the moonlit, snow-covered
meadows to the hill back of
Farmer Brown's house. On that
hill was the young peach orchard
of which Tommy Tit the Chickadee
had told him, and ever since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Peter's mouth had watered and
watered every time he thought
of those young peach trees and
the tender bark on them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I will, Danny, just
this once,&#8221; said Peter. &#8220;It's a long
way, and I've never been there
before; but I guess it's just as
safe as the Meadows or the Green
Forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that, Peter Rabbit
left the dear, safe Old Briar-patch,
and away he went lipperty-lipperty-lip,
across the Green Meadows
toward the hill and the
young orchard back of Farmer
Brown's house.</p>

<p>Danny Meadow Mouse watched
him go and shook his head in
disapproval. &#8220;Foolish, foolish,
foolish!&#8221; he said over and over
to himself. &#8220;Why can't Peter be
content with the good things
that he has?&#8221;</p>

<p>Peter Rabbit hurried along
through the moonlight, stopping
every few minutes to sit up to
look and listen. He heard the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
fierce hunting call of Hooty the
Owl way over in the Green Forest,
so he felt sure that at present
there was nothing to fear from
him. He knew that since their
return to the Green Meadows
and the Green Forest, Granny
and Reddy Fox had kept away
from Farmer Brown's, so he did
not worry about them.</p>

<p>All in good time Peter came
to the young orchard. It was just
as Tommy Tit the Chickadee
had told him. Peter hopped up
to the nearest peach tree and
nibbled the bark. My, how good
it tasted! He went all around
the tree, stripping off the bark.
He stood up on his long hind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
legs and reached as high as he
could. Then he dug the snow
away and ate down as far as he
could. When he could get no
more tender young bark, he went
on to the next tree.</p>

<p>Now, though Peter didn't know
it, he was in the very worst kind
of mischief. You see, when he
took off all the bark all the way
around the young peach tree, he
killed the tree, for you know it
is on the inside of the bark that
the sap which gives life to a tree
and makes it grow goes up from
the roots to all the branches. So
when Peter ate the bark all the
way around the trunk of the
young tree, he had made it impossible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
for the sap to come up
in the spring. Oh, it was the
worst kind of mischief that Peter
Rabbit was in.</p>

<p>But Peter didn't know it, and
he kept right on filling that big
stomach of his and enjoying it so
much that he forgot to watch out
for danger. Suddenly, just as he
had begun on another tree, a
great roar right behind him made
him jump almost out of his skin.
He knew that voice, and without
waiting to even look behind him,
he started for the stone wall on
the other side of the orchard.
Right at his heels, his great
mouth wide open, was Bowser
the Hound.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

Farmer Brown<br />
Sets a Trap</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">P</span>eter Rabbit</span> was in trouble.
He had got into mischief
and now, like everyone who gets
into mischief, he wished that he
hadn't. The worst of it was that
he was a long way from his
home in the dear Old Briar-patch,
and he didn't know how he ever
could get back there again.
Where was he? Why, in the stone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
wall on one side of Farmer
Brown's young peach orchard.
How Peter blessed the old stone
wall in which he had found a
safe hiding place! Bowser had
hung around nearly all night, so
that Peter had not dared to try
to go home. Now it was daylight,
and Peter knew it would not be
safe to put his nose outside.</p>

<p>Peter was worried, so worried
that he couldn't go to sleep as
he usually does in the daytime.
So he sat hidden in the old wall
and waited and watched. By and
by he saw Farmer Brown and
Farmer Brown's boy come out
into the orchard. Right away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
they saw the mischief which
Peter had done, and he could
tell by the sound of their voices
that they were very, very angry.
They went away, but before long
they were back again, and all day
long Peter watched them work
putting something around each
of the young peach trees. Peter
grew so curious that he forgot
all about his troubles and how
far away from home he was. He
could hardly wait for night to
come so that he might see what
they had been doing.</p>

<p>Just as jolly, round, red Mr.
Sun started to go to bed behind
the Purple Hills, Farmer Brown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and his boy started back to the
house. Farmer Brown was smiling
now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that will fix him!&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what does he mean by
that?&#8221; thought Peter. &#8220;Whom will
it fix? Can it be me? I don't
need any fixing.&#8221;</p>

<p class="caption"><i>All around the trunk of the tree was
wrapped wire netting</i></p>

<p>He waited just as long as he
could. When all was still, and
the moonlight had begun to
make shadows of the trees on the
snow, Peter very cautiously crept
out of his hiding place. Bowser
the Hound was nowhere in sight,
and everything was as quiet and
peaceful as it had been when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
first came into the orchard the
night before. Peter had fully
made up his mind to go straight
home as fast as his long legs
would take him, but his dreadful
curiosity insisted that first he
must find out what Farmer
Brown and his boy had been
doing to the young peach trees.</p>

<p>So Peter hurried over to the
nearest tree. All around the trunk
of the tree, from the ground
clear up higher than Peter could
reach, was wrapped wire netting.
Peter couldn't get so much as a
nibble of the delicious bark. He
hadn't intended to take any, for
he had meant to go right straight
home, but now that he couldn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
get any, he wanted some more
than ever&mdash;just a bite. Peter
looked around. Everything was
quiet. He would try the next
tree, and then he would go home.</p>

<p>But the next tree was wrapped
with wire. Peter hesitated, looked
around, turned to go home,
thought of how good that bark
had tasted the night before, hesitated
again, and then hurried
over to the third tree. It was
protected just like the others.
Then Peter forgot all about
going home. He wanted some of
that delicious bark, and he ran
from one tree to another as fast
as he could go.</p>

<p>At last, way down at the end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of the orchard, Peter found a
tree that had no wire around it.
&#8220;They must have forgotten this
one!&#8221; he thought, and his eyes
sparkled. All around on the snow
were a lot of shiny little wires,
but Peter didn't notice them.
All he saw was that delicious
bark on the young peach tree.
He hopped right into the middle
of the wires, and then, just as he
reached up to take the first bite
of bark, he felt something tugging
at one of his hind legs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>



<h3><a name="XV" id="XV"></a><small>XV</small><br />

Peter Rabbit Is<br />
Caught in a Snare</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen</span> Peter Rabbit, reaching
up to nibble the bark of
one of Farmer Brown's young
trees, felt something tugging at
one of his hind legs, he was so
startled that he jumped to get
away. Instead of doing this, he
fell flat on his face. The thing
on his hind leg had tightened
and held him fast. A great fear
came to Peter Rabbit, and lying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
there in the snow, he kicked and
struggled with all his might. But
the more he kicked, the tighter
grew that hateful thing on his
leg! Finally he grew too tired to
kick any more and lay still. The
dreadful thing that held him
hurt his leg, but it didn't pull
when he lay still.</p>

<p>When he had grown a little
calmer, Peter sat up to examine
the thing which held him so
fast. It was something like one
of the blackberry vines he had
sometimes tripped over, only it
was bright and shiny, and had
no branches or tiny prickers, and
one end was fastened to a stake.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Peter tried to bite off the shiny
thing, but even his great, sharp
front teeth couldn't cut it. Then
Peter knew what it was. It was
wire! It was a snare which Farmer
Brown had set to catch him, and
which he had walked right into
because he had been so greedy
for the bark of the young peach
tree that he had not used his eyes
to look out for danger.</p>

<p>Oh, how Peter Rabbit did wish
that he had not been so curious
to know what Farmer Brown had
been doing that day, and that he
had gone straight home as he had
meant to do, instead of trying
to get one more meal of young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
peach bark! Big tears rolled down
Peter's cheeks. What should he
do? What could he do? For
a long time Peter sat in the
moonlight, trying to think of
something to do. At last he
thought of the stake to which
that hateful wire was fastened.
The stake was of wood, and
Peter's teeth would cut wood.
Peter's heart gave a great leap
of hope, and he began at once
to dig away the snow from
around the stake, and then settled
himself to gnaw the stake in two.</p>

<p>Peter had been hard at work
on the stake a long time and had
it a little more than half cut
through, when he heard a loud<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
sniff down at the other end of
the orchard. He looked up to
see&mdash;whom do you think? Why,
Bowser the Hound! He hadn't
seen Peter yet, but he had already
found Peter's tracks, and
it would be but a few minutes
before he found Peter himself.</p>

<p>Poor Peter Rabbit! There
wasn't time to finish cutting off
the stake. What could he do? He
made a frightened jump just as
he had when he first felt the
wire tugging at his leg. Just as
before, he was thrown flat on his
face. He scrambled to his feet
and jumped again, only to be
thrown just as before. Just then
Bowser the Hound saw him and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
opening his mouth sent forth a
great roar. Peter made one more
frantic jump. Snap! The stake had
broken! Peter pitched forward on
his head, turned a somersault,
and scrambled to his feet. He was
free at last! That is, he could
run, but after him dragged a
piece of the stake.</p>

<p>How Peter did run! It was
hard work, for you know he had
to drag that piece of stake after
him. But he did it, and just in
time he crawled into the old
stone wall on one side of the
orchard, while Bowser the Hound
barked his disappointment to the
moon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>



<h3><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a><small>XVI</small><br />

Peter Rabbit's<br />
Hard Journey</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">P</span>eter Rabbit</span> sat in the
old stone wall along one side
of Farmer Brown's orchard, waiting
for Mrs. Moon to put out her
light and leave the world in darkness
until jolly, round, red Mr.
Sun should kick off his rosy bed-clothes
and begin his daily climb
up in the blue, blue sky. In the
winter, Mr. Sun is a late sleeper,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and Peter knew that there would
be two or three hours after Mrs.
Moon put out her light when it
would be quite dark. And Peter
also knew that by this time
Hooty the Owl would probably
have caught his dinner. So would
old Granny Fox and Reddy Fox.
Bowser the Hound would be too
sleepy to be on the watch. It
would be the very safest time for
Peter to try to get to his home
in the dear Old Briar-patch.</p>

<p>So Peter waited and waited.
Twice Bowser the Hound, who
had chased him into the old wall,
came over and barked at him
and tried to get at him. But the
old wall kept Peter safe, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Bowser gave it up. And all the
time Peter sat waiting he was in
great pain. You see, that shiny
wire was drawn so tight that it
cut into his flesh and hurt dreadfully,
and to the other end of the
wire was fastened a piece of
wood, part of the stake to which
the snare had been made fast
and which Peter had managed to
gnaw and break off.</p>

<p>It was on account of this that
Peter was waiting for Mrs. Moon
to put out her light. He knew
that with that stake dragging
after him he would have to go
very slowly, and he could not
run any more risk of danger than
he actually had to. So he waited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and waited, and by and by, sure
enough, Mrs. Moon put out her
light. Peter waited a little longer,
listening with all his might.
Everything was still. Then Peter
crept out of the old stone wall.</p>

<p>Right away trouble began. The
stake dragging at the end of the
wire fast to his leg caught among
the stones and pulled Peter up
short. My, how it did hurt! It
made the tears come. But Peter
shut his teeth hard, and turning
back, he worked until he got the
stake free. Then he started on
once more, dragging the stake
after him.</p>

<p>Very slowly across the orchard
and under the fence on the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
side crept Peter Rabbit, his leg
so stiff and sore that he could
hardly touch it to the snow, and
all the time dragging that piece
of stake, which seemed to grow
heavier and harder to drag every
minute. Peter did not dare to go
out across the open fields, for
fear some danger might happen
along, and he would have no
place to hide. So he crept along
close to the fences where bushes
grow, and this made it very, very
hard, for the dragging stake was
forever catching in the bushes
with a yank at the sore leg which
brought Peter up short with a
squeal of pain.</p>

<p>This was bad enough, but all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the time Peter was filled with a
dreadful fear that Hooty the Owl
or Granny Fox might just happen
along. He had to stop to rest
very, very often, and then he
would listen and listen. Over and
over again he said to himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, whatever did I go
up to the young peach orchard
for when I knew I had no
business there? Why couldn't I
have been content with all the
good things that were mine in
the Green Forest and on the
Green Meadows? Oh dear! Oh
dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as jolly, round, red Mr.
Sun began to light up the Green<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Meadows, Peter Rabbit reached
the dear Old Briar-patch. Danny
Meadow Mouse was sitting on the
edge of it anxiously watching for
him. Peter crawled up and started
to creep in along one of his little
private paths. He got in himself,
but the dragging stake caught
among the brambles, and Peter
just fell down in the snow right
where he was, too tired and worn
out to move.</p>

Danny Meadow
Mouse<br /> Becomes
Worried</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">D</span>anny Meadow Mouse</span>
limped around through the
dear Old Briar-patch, where he
had lived with Peter Rabbit ever
since he had squirmed out of the
claws of Hooty the Owl and
dropped there, right at the feet
of Peter Rabbit. Danny limped
because he was still lame and
sore from Hooty's terrible claws,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
but he didn't let himself think
much about that, because he was
so thankful to be alive at all.
So he limped around in the
Old Briar-patch, picking up seed
which had fallen on the snow,
and sometimes pulling down a
few of the red berries which cling
all winter to the wild rose
bushes. The seeds in these were
very nice indeed, and Danny always
felt especially good after a
meal of them.</p>

<p>Danny Meadow Mouse had
grown very fond of Peter Rabbit,
for Peter had been very, very
good to him. Danny felt that he
never, never could repay all of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Peter's kindness. It had been very
good of Peter to offer to share
the Old Briar-patch with Danny
because Danny was so far from
his own home that it would not
be safe for him to try to get back
there. But Peter had done more
than that. He had taken care of
Danny, such good care, during
the first few days after Danny's
escape from Hooty the Owl. He
had brought good things to eat
while Danny was too weak and
sore to get things for himself.
Oh, Peter had been very good
indeed to him!</p>

<p>But now, as Danny limped
around, he was not happy. No,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Sir, he was not happy. The truth
is, Danny Meadow Mouse was
worried. It was a different kind
of worry from any he had known
before. You see, for the first time
in his life, Danny was worrying
about someone else. He was
worrying about Peter Rabbit.
Peter had been gone from the
Old Briar-patch a whole night
and a whole day. He often was
gone all night, but never all day
too. Danny was sure that something
had happened to Peter. He
thought of how he had begged
Peter not to go up to Farmer
Brown's young peach orchard. He
had felt in his bones that it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
not safe, that something dreadful
would happen to Peter. How
Peter had laughed at him and bravely
started off! Why hadn't
he come home?</p>

<p>As he limped around, Danny
talked to himself:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Why cannot people be content<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the good things that are sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mind their own affairs at home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instead of going forth to roam?&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was now the second night
since Peter Rabbit had gone
away. Danny Meadow Mouse
couldn't sleep at all. Round and
round through the Old Briar-patch
he limped, and finally sat
down at the edge of it to wait<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and watch. At last, just as jolly,
round, red Mr. Sun sent his first
long rays of light across the
Green Meadows, Danny saw something
crawling toward the Old
Briar-patch. He rubbed his eyes
and looked again. It was&mdash;no, it
couldn't be&mdash;yes, it was Peter
Rabbit! But what was the matter
with him? Always before Peter
had come home lipperty-lipperty-lipperty-lip,
but now he was
crawling, actually crawling! Danny
Meadow Mouse didn't know what
to make of it.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came Peter.
Something was following him. No,
Peter was dragging something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
after him. At last Peter started
to crawl along one of his little
private paths into the Old Briar-patch.
The thing dragging behind
caught in the brambles, and
Peter fell headlong in the snow,
too tired and worn out to move.
Then Danny saw what the
trouble was. A wire was fast to
one of Peter's long hind legs,
and to the other end of the wire
was fastened part of a stake.
Peter had been caught in a
snare! Danny hurried over to
Peter and tears stood in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Peter Rabbit! Oh, I'm
so sorry, Peter!&#8221; he whispered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> Peter Rabbit lay. He
had dragged that piece of
stake a long way, a very long
way, indeed. But now he could
drag it no farther, for it had
caught in the bramble bushes.
So Peter just dropped on the
snow and cried. Yes, Sir, he cried!
You see, he was so tired and
worn out and frightened, and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
leg was so stiff and sore and hurt
him so! And then it was so
dreadful to actually get home and
be stopped right on your very
own doorstep. So Peter just lay
there and cried. Just supposing
old Granny Fox should come
poking around and find Peter
caught that way! All she would
have to do would be to get hold
of that hateful stake caught in
the bramble bushes and pull
Peter out where she could get
him. Do you wonder that Peter
cried?</p>

<p>By and by he became aware
that someone was wiping away
his tears. It was Danny Meadow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Mouse. And Danny was singing
in a funny little voice. Pretty
soon Peter stopped crying and
listened, and this is what he
heard:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Isn't any use to cry!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a bit! Not a bit!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wipe your eyes and wipe 'em dry!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Use your wit! Use your wit!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just remember that tomorrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never brings a single sorrow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yesterday has gone forever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tomorrow gets here never.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chase your worries all away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing's worse than just today.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Peter smiled in spite of himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's right! That's right!
Smile away, Peter Rabbit. Smile
away! Your troubles, Sir, are all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
today. And between you and me,
I don't believe they are so bad
as you think they are. Now you
lie still just where you are, while
I go see what can be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that, off whisked Danny
Meadow Mouse as spry as you
please, in spite of his lame leg,
and in a few minutes Peter knew
by little twitches of the wire on
his leg that Danny was doing
something at the other end. He
was. Danny Meadow Mouse had
set out to gnaw that piece of
stake all to splinters. So there he
sat and gnawed and gnawed and
gnawed. Jolly, round, red Mr.
Sun climbed higher and higher<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
in the sky, and Danny Meadow
Mouse grew hungry, but still he
kept right on gnawing at that
bothersome stake.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Danny Meadow Mouse had set out to gnaw
that piece of stake all to splinters</i></p>

<p>By and by, happening to look
across the snow-covered Green
Meadows, he saw something that
made his heart jump. It was
Farmer Brown's boy coming
straight over toward the dear
Old Briar-patch.</p>

<p>Danny didn't say a word to
Peter Rabbit, but gnawed faster
than ever.</p>

<p>Farmer Brown's boy was almost
there when Danny stopped gnawing.
There was only a tiny bit of
the stake left now, and Danny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
hurried to tell Peter Rabbit that
there was nothing to stop him
now from going to his most
secret retreat in the very heart of
the Old Briar-patch. While Peter
slowly dragged his way along,
Danny trotted behind to see that
the wire did not catch on the
bushes.</p>

<p>They had safely reached Peter
Rabbit's secretest retreat when
Farmer Brown's boy came up to
the edge of the dear Old Briar-patch.</p>

<p>&#8220;So this is where that rabbit
that killed our peach tree lives!&#8221;
said he. &#8220;We'll try a few snares
and put you out of mischief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>And for the rest of the afternoon
Farmer Brown's boy was
very busy around the edge of the
Old Briar-patch.</p>

Peter Rabbit and<br />
Danny Meadow
Mouse Live High</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">P</span>eter Rabbit</span> sat in his
secretest place in the dear
Old Briar-patch with one of his
long hind legs all swelled up and
terribly sore because of the fine
wire fast around it and cutting
into it. He could hear Farmer
Brown's boy going around on the
edge of the dear Old Briar-patch
and stopping every little while to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
do something. In spite of his
pain, Peter was curious. Finally
he called Danny Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Danny, you are small and can
keep out of sight easier than I
can. Go as near as ever you dare
to Farmer Brown's boy and find
out what he is doing,&#8221; said Peter
Rabbit.</p>

<p>So Danny Meadow Mouse crept
out as near to Farmer Brown's
boy as ever he dared, and studied
and studied to make out what
Farmer Brown's boy was doing.
By and by he returned to Peter
Rabbit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know what he's doing,
Peter, but he's putting something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
in every one of your private little
paths leading into the Briar-patch
from the Green Meadows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; said Peter Rabbit.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are little loops of that
queer stuff you've got hanging
to your leg, Peter,&#8221; continued
Danny Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so!&#8221; said Peter Rabbit.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he's put cabbage leaves
and pieces of apple all around,&#8221;
said Danny.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must be careful!&#8221; said
Peter Rabbit.</p>

<p>Peter's leg was in a very bad
way, indeed, and Peter suffered a
great deal of pain. The worst of
it was, he didn't know how to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
off the wire that was cutting into
it so. He had tried to cut the
wire with his big teeth, but he
couldn't do it. Danny Meadow
Mouse had tried and tried to
gnaw the wire, but it wasn't the
least bit of use. But Danny wasn't
easily discouraged, and he kept
working and working at it. Once
he thought he felt it slip a little.
He said nothing, but kept right
on working. Pretty soon he was
sure that it slipped. He went
right on working harder than
ever. By and by he had it so
loose that he slipped it right off
Peter's leg, and Peter didn't know
anything about it. You see, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
cruel wire snare had been so
tight that Peter didn't have any
feeling except of pain left in his
leg, and so when Danny Meadow
Mouse pulled the cruel wire
snare off, Peter didn't know it
until Danny held it up in front
of him.</p>

<p>My, how thankful Peter was,
and how he did thank Danny
Meadow Mouse! But Danny said
that it was nothing at all, just
nothing at all, and that he owed
more than that to Peter Rabbit
for being so good to him and
letting him live in the dear Old
Briar-patch.</p>

<p>It was a long time before Peter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
could hop as he used to, but
after the first day he managed
to get around. He found that
Farmer Brown's boy had spread
those miserable wire snares in
every one of his private little
paths. But Peter knew what they
were now. He showed Danny
Meadow Mouse how he, because
he was so small, could safely
run about among the snares and
steal all the cabbage leaves and
apples which Farmer Brown's boy
had put there for bait.</p>

<p>Danny Meadow Mouse thought
this great fun and a great joke
on Farmer Brown's boy. So every
day he stole the bait, and he and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Peter Rabbit lived high while
Peter's leg was getting well. And
all the time Farmer Brown's boy
wondered why he couldn't catch
Peter Rabbit.</p>

Timid Danny
Meadow Mouse</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">D</span>anny Meadow Mouse</span>
is timid. Everybody says so,
and what everybody says ought to
be so. But just as anybody can
make a mistake sometimes, so
can everybody. Still, in this case,
it is quite likely that everybody
is right. Danny Meadow Mouse
is timid. Ask Peter Rabbit. Ask
Sammy Jay. Ask Striped Chipmunk.
They will all tell you the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
same thing. Sammy Jay might
even tell you that Danny is
afraid of his own shadow, or that
he tries to run away from his
own tail. Of course this isn't
true. Sammy Jay likes to say
mean things. It isn't fair to
Danny Meadow Mouse to believe
what Sammy Jay says.</p>

<p>But the fact is Danny certainly
is timid. More than this, he isn't
ashamed of it&mdash;not the least little
bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, it's this way,&#8221; said
Danny, as he sat on his doorstep
one sunny morning talking to
his friend, old Mr. Toad. &#8220;If I
weren't afraid, I wouldn't be all
the time watching out, and if I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
weren't all the time watching out,
I wouldn't have any more chance
than that foolish red ant running
across in front of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Mr. Toad looked where
Danny was pointing, and his
tongue darted out and back again
so quickly that Danny wasn't sure
that he saw it at all, but when
he looked for the ant it was nowhere
to be seen, and there was
a satisfied twinkle in Mr. Toad's
eyes. There was an answering
twinkle in Danny's own eyes as
he continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I wouldn't
stand a particle more chance than
that foolish ant did. Now if I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
were big and strong, like Old
Man Coyote, or had swift wings,
like Skimmer the Swallow, or
were so homely and ugly looking
that no one wanted me, like&mdash;like&mdash;&#8221;
Danny hesitated and then
finished rather lamely, &#8220;like some
folks I know, I suppose I
wouldn't be afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Mr. Toad looked up
sharply when Danny mentioned
homely and ugly-looking people,
but Danny was gazing far out
across the Green Meadows and
looked so innocent that Mr.
Toad concluded that he couldn't
have had him in mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, thoughtfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
scratching his nose, &#8220;I suppose
you may be right, but for my
part fear seems a very foolish
thing. Now, I don't know what it
is. I mind my own business, and
no one ever bothers me. I should
think it would be a very uncomfortable
feeling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; replied Danny, &#8220;but, as
I said before, it is a very good
thing to keep one on guard
when there are as many watching
for one as there are for me. Now
there's Mr. Blacksnake and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; exclaimed old Mr.
Toad, turning as pale as a toad
can turn, and looking uneasily
and anxiously in every direction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p class="figcenter"><a name="illo11" id="illo11"></a><a href="images/153.jpg"><img src="images/153_th.jpg"

as pale as a toad can turn</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Danny turned his head to hide
a smile. If old Mr. Toad wasn't
showing fear, no one ever did.
&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I didn't mean
that he is anywhere around here
now. What I was going to say
was that there is Mr. Blacksnake
and Granny Fox and Reddy Fox
and Redtail the Hawk and Hooty
the Owl and others I might
name, always watching for a
chance to make a dinner from
poor little me. Do you wonder
that I am afraid most of the
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied old Mr. Toad.
&#8220;No, I don't wonder that you
are afraid. It must be dreadful to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
feel hungry eyes are watching for
you every minute of the day and
night, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it's not so bad,&#8221; replied
Danny. &#8220;It's rather exciting. Besides,
it keeps my wits sharp all
the time. I am afraid I should
find life very dull indeed if, like
you, I feared nothing and nobody.
By the way, see how
queerly that grass is moving over
there. It looks as if Mr. Blacksnake&mdash;
Why, Mr. Toad, where
are you going in such a hurry?&#8221;</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a name="illo12" id="illo12"></a><a href="images/156.jpg"><img src="images/156_th.jpg"

<p class="caption"><i>&#8220;Why, Mr. Toad, where are you going in

<p>&#8220;I've just remembered an important

cousin, Grandfather Frog, at the
Smiling Pool,&#8221; shouted old Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Toad over his shoulder, as he
hurried so that he fell over his
own feet.</p>

<p>Danny chuckled as he sat alone
on his doorstep. &#8220;Oh, no, old
Mr. Toad doesn't know what
fear is!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Funny how
some people won't admit what
everybody can see for themselves.
Now, I am afraid, and I'm willing
to say so.&#8221;</p>

An Exciting Day
for<br /> Danny Meadow
Mouse</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">D</span>anny Meadow Mouse</span>
started along one of his private
little paths very early one
morning. He was on his way to
get a supply of a certain kind
of grass seed of which he is very
fond. He had been thinking
about that seed for some time
and waiting for it to get ripe.
Now it was just right, as he had
found out the day before by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
visit to the place where this particular
grass grew. The only
trouble was it grew a long way
from Danny's home, and to reach
it he had to cross an open place
where the grass was so short that
he couldn't make a path under it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel it in my bones that this
is going to be an exciting day,&#8221;
said Danny to himself as he
trotted along. &#8220;I suppose that if
I were really wise, I would stay
nearer home and do without that
nice seed. But nothing is really
worth having unless it is worth
working for, and that seed will
taste all the better if I have hard
work getting it.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he trotted along his private<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
little path, his ears wide open,
and his eyes wide open, and his
little nose carefully testing every
Merry Little Breeze who happened
along for any scent of danger
which it might carry. Most
of all he depended upon his ears,
for the grass was so tall that he
couldn't see over it, even when
he sat up. He had gone only a
little way when he thought he
heard a queer rustling behind
him. He stopped to listen. There
it was again, and it certainly was
right in the path behind him!
He didn't need to be told who
was making it. There was only
one who could make such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
sound as that&mdash;Mr. Blacksnake.</p>

<p>Now Danny can run very fast
along his private little paths, but
he knew that Mr. Blacksnake
could run faster. &#8220;If my legs
can't save me, my wits must,&#8221;
thought Danny as he started to
run as fast as ever he could. &#8220;I
must reach that fallen old hollow
fence post.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was almost out of breath
when he reached the post and
scurried into the open end. He
knew by the sound of the rustling
that Mr. Blacksnake was
right at his heels. Now the old
post was hollow its whole length,
but halfway there was an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
knothole just big enough for
Danny to squeeze through. Mr.
Blacksnake didn't know anything
about that hole, and because it
was dark inside the old post, he
didn't see Danny pop through it.
Danny ran back along the top of
the log and was just in time to
see the tip of Mr. Blacksnake's
tail disappear inside. Then what
do you think Danny did? Why,
he followed Mr. Blacksnake right
into the old post, but in doing
it he didn't make the least little
bit of noise.</p>

<p>Mr. Blacksnake kept right on
through the old post and out the
other end, for he was sure that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
that was the way Danny had
gone. He kept right on along the
little path. Now Danny knew
that he wouldn't go very far before
he found out that he had
been fooled, and of course he
would come back. So Danny
waited only long enough to get
his breath and then ran back
along the path to where another
little path branched off. For just
a minute he paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Mr. Blacksnake follows me,
he will be sure to think that of
course I have taken this other
little path,&#8221; thought Danny, &#8220;so
I won't do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he ran harder than ever,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
until he came to a place where
two little paths branched off, one
to the right and one to the left.
He took the latter and scampered
on, sure that by this time Mr.
Blacksnake would be so badly
fooled that he would give up the
chase. And Danny was right.</p>

<span class="i0">&#8220;Brains are better far than speed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As wise men long ago agreed,&#8221;<br /></span>

<p>said Danny, as he trotted on his
way for the grass seed he liked
so well. &#8220;I felt it in my bones
that this would be an exciting
day. I wonder what next.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

What Happened
Next<br /> to Danny
Meadow Mouse</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">D</span>anny</span> is so used to narrow
escapes that he doesn't waste
any time thinking about them.
He didn't this time. &#8220;He who
tries to look two ways at once is
pretty sure to see nothing,&#8221; says
Danny, and he knew that if he
thought too much about the
things that had already happened,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
he couldn't keep a sharp watch
for the things that might happen.</p>

<p>Nothing more happened as he
hurried along his private little
path to the edge of a great patch
of grass so short that he couldn't
hide under it. He had to cross
this, and all the way he would
be in plain sight of anyone who
happened to be near. Very cautiously
he peeped out and looked
this way and looked that way,
not forgetting to look up in the
sky. He could see no one anywhere.
Drawing a long breath,
Danny started across the open
place as fast as his short legs
could take him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Now all the time, Redtail the
Hawk had been sitting in a tree
some distance away, sitting so still
that he looked like a part of the
tree itself. That is why Danny
hadn't seen him. But Redtail saw
Danny the instant he started across
the open place, for Redtail's eyes
are very keen, and he can see a
great distance. With a satisfied
chuckle, he spread his broad
wings and started after Danny.</p>

<p>Just about halfway to the safety
of the long grass on the other
side, Danny gave a hurried look
behind him, and his heart seemed
to jump right into his mouth,
for there was Redtail with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
cruel claws already set to seize
him! Danny gave a frightened
squeak, for he thought that surely
this time he would be caught.
But he didn't mean to give up
without trying to escape. Three
jumps ahead of him was a queer-looking
thing. He didn't know
what it was, but if there was a
hole in it he might yet fool Redtail.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a name="illo13" id="illo13"></a><a href="images/169.jpg"><img src="images/169_th.jpg"
alt="" title="" /></a></p>

<p class="caption"><i>With a frightened squeak, Danny dived into
the opening just in time</i></p>

<p>One jump! Would he be able
to reach it? Two jumps! There
was a hole in it! Three jumps!
With another frightened squeak,
Danny dived into the opening
just in time. And what do you
think he was in? Why, an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
tomato can Farmer Brown's boy
had once used to carry bait in
when he went fishing at the
Smiling Pool. He had dropped it
there on his way home.</p>

<p>Redtail screamed with rage and
disappointment as he struck the
old can with his great claws. He
had been sure, very sure, of Danny
Meadow Mouse this time! He
tried to pick the can up, but he
couldn't get hold of it. It just
rolled away from him every time,
try as he would. Finally, in disgust,
he gave up and flew back
to the tree from which he had
first seen Danny.</p>

<p>Of course Danny had been terribly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
frightened when the can
rolled, and by the noise the claws
of Redtail made when they struck
his queer hiding place. But he
wisely decided that the best thing
he could do was to stay there
for a while. And it was very fortunate
that he did so, as he was
very soon to find out.</p>

Reddy Fox Grows
Curious</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">D</span>anny Meadow Mouse</span>
had sat perfectly still for a
long time inside the old tomato
can in which he had found a
refuge from Redtail the Hawk.
He didn't dare so much as put
his head out for a look around,
lest Redtail should be circling
overhead ready to pounce on
him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;If I stay here long enough,
he'll get tired and go away, if he
hasn't already,&#8221; thought Danny.
&#8220;This has been a pretty exciting
morning so far, and I find that I
am a little tired. I may as well
take a nap while I am waiting to
make sure that the way is clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that Danny curled up in
the old tomato can. But it wasn't
meant that Danny should have
that nap. He had closed his eyes,
but his ears were still open, and
presently he heard soft footsteps
drawing near. His eyes flew open,
and he forgot all about sleep,
you may be sure, for those footsteps
sounded familiar. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
sounded to Danny very, very
much like the footsteps of&mdash;whom
do you think? Why,
Reddy Fox! Danny's heart began
to beat faster as he listened.
Could it be? He didn't dare peep
out. Presently a little whiff of
scent blew into the old tomato
can. Then Danny knew&mdash;it was
Reddy Fox.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear! I hope he doesn't
find that I am in here!&#8221; thought
Danny. &#8220;I wonder what under
the sun has brought him up here
just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>If the truth were to be known,
it was curiosity that had brought
Reddy up there. Reddy had been
hunting for his breakfast some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
distance away on the Green
Meadows when Redtail the Hawk
had tried so hard to catch Danny
Meadow Mouse. Reddy's sharp
eyes had seen Redtail the minute
he left the tree in pursuit of
Danny, and he had known by the
way Redtail flew that he saw
something he wanted to catch.
He had watched Redtail swoop
down and had heard his scream
of rage when he missed Danny
because Danny had dodged into
the old tomato can. He had seen
Redtail strike and strike again at
something on the ground, and
finally fly off in disgust with
empty claws.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I wonder what it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Redtail was after and why he
didn't get it,&#8221; thought Reddy.
&#8220;He acts terribly put out and disappointed.
I believe I'll go over
there and find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Off he started at a smart trot
toward the patch of short grass
where he had seen Redtail the
Hawk striking at something on
the ground. As he drew near, he
crept very softly until he reached
the very edge of the open patch.
There he stopped and looked
sharply all over it. There was
nothing to be seen but an old
tomato can. Reddy had seen it
many times before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what under the sun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
could Redtail have been after
here?&#8221; thought Reddy. &#8220;The
grass isn't long enough for a
grasshopper to hide in, and yet
Redtail didn't get what he was
after. It's very queer. It certainly
is very queer.&#8221;</p>

<p>He trotted out and began to
run back and forth with his nose
to the ground, hoping that his
nose would tell him what his
eyes couldn't. Back and forth,
back and forth he ran, and then
suddenly he stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; exclaimed Reddy. He
had found the scent left by
Danny Meadow Mouse when he
ran across toward the old tomato<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
can. Right up to the old can
Reddy's nose led him. He hopped
over the old can, but on the
other side he could find no scent
of Danny Meadow Mouse. In a
flash he understood, and a gleam
of satisfaction shone in his yellow
eyes as he turned back to the
old can. He knew that Danny
must be hiding in there.</p>

<p>&#8220;I've got you this time!&#8221; he
snarled, as he sniffed at the opening
in the end of the can.</p>

Reddy Fox Loses
His Temper</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">R</span>eddy Fox</span> had caught
Danny Meadow Mouse, and
yet he hadn't caught him. He
had found Danny hiding in the
old tomato can, and it didn't enter
Reddy's head that he couldn't
get Danny out when he wanted
to. He was in no hurry. He had
had a pretty good breakfast of
grasshoppers, and so he thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
he would torment Danny awhile
before gobbling him up. He lay
down so that he could peep in at
the open end of the old can and
see Danny trying to make himself
as small as possible at the other
end. Reddy grinned until he
showed all his long teeth. Reddy
always is a bully, especially when
his victim is a great deal smaller
and weaker than himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I've got you this time,
Mr. Smarty, haven't I?&#8221; taunted
Reddy.</p>

<p>Danny didn't say anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think you've been very
clever because you have fooled
me two or three times, don't you?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Well, this time I've got you
where your tricks won't work,&#8221;
continued Reddy, &#8220;so what are
you going to do about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Danny didn't answer. The fact
is, he was too frightened to answer.
Besides, he didn't know
what he could do. So he just
kept still, but his bright eyes
never once left Reddy's cruel
face. For all his fright, Danny
was doing some hard thinking.
He had been in tight places before
and had learned never to
give up hope. Something might
happen to frighten Reddy away.
Anyway, Reddy had to get him
out of that old can before he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
would admit that he was really
caught.</p>

<p>For a long time Reddy lay
there licking his chops and saying
all the things he could think
of to frighten poor Danny
Meadow Mouse. At last he grew
tired of this and made up his
mind that that it was time to end
it and Danny Meadow Mouse at
the same time. He thrust his
sharp nose in at the opening in
the end of the old can, but the
opening was too small for him
to get more than his nose in,
and he only scratched it on the
sharp edges without so much as
touching Danny.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I'll pull you out,&#8221; said Reddy
and thrust in one black paw.</p>

<p>Danny promptly bit it so hard
that Reddy yelped with pain
and pulled it out in a hurry.
Presently he tried again with the
other paw. Danny bit this one
harder still, and Reddy danced
with pain and anger. Then he
lost his temper completely, a very
foolish thing to do, as it always
is. He hit the old can, and away
it rolled with Danny Meadow
Mouse inside. This seemed to
make Reddy angrier than ever.
He sprang after it and hit it
again. Then he batted it first this
way and then that way, growing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
angrier and angrier. And all the
time Danny Meadow Mouse managed
to keep inside, although he
got a terrible shaking up.</p>

<p>Back and forth across the patch
of short grass Reddy knocked the
old can, and he was in such a
rage that he didn't notice where
he was knocking it to. Finally he
sent it spinning into the long
grass on the far side of the open
patch, close to one of Danny's
private little paths. Like a flash
Danny was out and scurrying
along the little path. He dodged
into another and presently into a
third, which brought him to
a tangle of barbed wire left there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
by Farmer Brown when he had
built a new fence. Under this he
was safe.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Like a flash, Danny dodged into a tangle
of barbed wire</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Phew!&#8221; exclaimed Danny,
breathing very hard. &#8220;That was
the narrowest escape yet! But I
guess I'll get that special grass
seed I started out for, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he did, while to this day
Reddy Fox wonders how Danny
got out of the old tomato can
without his knowing it.</p>
